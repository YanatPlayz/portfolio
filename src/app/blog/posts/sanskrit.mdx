> कथमर्थं निषेधन्तु श्रुतयः स्मृतयोऽपि वा । यासामेकं पदमपि न चलत्यर्थतो विना ॥ [^1]

*How could meaning be denied by [Śruti](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/shruti) (the Vedas) or [Smṛti](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/smriti), if even a single word does not move (function) without its meaning?*

In Sanskrit intellectual tradition, meaning was not incidental in across texts. Not even a single word was thought to function without purpose or semantic weight. This [śloka](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sloka) above testifies that language is treated as intentional with precise regard to meaning.

This project aims to begin from that same perspective and respect for meaning. I seek to answer these following question: 

1. *How do meanings of specific words emerge from usage across large bodies of Sanskrit text?*
2. *How might those patterns change across time?*
3. *Can modern computational tools (namely [word embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding)) help us answer these questions?*

## Methodology

Filler text for now.
